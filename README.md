# UFO-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Dana provide more in depth analysis on UFO sightings by adding more filters so that users could be able to filter for more criteria at the same time. The final webpage includes filters such as date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The webpage ended up looking pretty styled with the functioning filters, which are easy to use and understand.

## Conclusion
Although this webpage is alright, one of the drawbacks is the limit of data when it comes to the amount of years you can filter through, and that along with maybe links to UFO related articles would be two ways that I can think of to make the webpage just that much cooler.
